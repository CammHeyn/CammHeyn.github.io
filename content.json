Intro to QM Linear Algebra Spectral Decomposition: Any normal operator \\(M\\) on a vector space \\(V\\) is diagonal w.r.t. some orthonormal basis for \\(V\\). Conversely, any diagonalizable (w.r.t. some orthonormal basis) operator is normal. Proof: The inverse is trivial. Now if \\(M^\\dagger M=MM^\\dagger\\), pick eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) and be \\(P\\) the projector onto its eigenspace, and \\(Q\\) the projector onto its orthogonal complement. Thus \\(P+Q=I\\), with \\(M=(P+Q)M(P+Q)\\). \\(PMP=\\lambda P\\), \\(QMP=0\\), \\(PMQ=0\\) since \\(\\forall |v\\rangle\\in P, MM^\\dagger|v\\rangle=\\lambda M^\\dagger|v\\rangle\\) which makes \\(M^\\dagger|v\\rangle\\in P\\), thus \\(QM^\\dagger P=0\\), in turn \\(PMQ=0\\). Now \\(M=PMP+QMQ\\), so \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) subspaces are invariant. Now for the \\(Q\\) subspace, \\[ \\begin{align} QMQQM^\\dagger Q&amp;=QMQM^\\dagger Q=QM(P+Q)M^\\dagger Q\\\\ &amp;=QMM^\\dagger Q=QM^\\dagger MQ=QM^\\dagger QMQ\\\\ &amp;=QM^\\dagger QQMQ \\end{align} \\] By induction on \\(\\dim V\\), we conclude that \\(M\\) is diagonalizable. Hilbert-Schmidt Trace Inner Product: \\((\\cdot,\\cdot):L_V\\times L_V\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{C}\\) by defining \\((A,B)\\equiv\\mbox{tr}(A^\\dagger B)\\). Pauli-matrices algebra \\[ [\\sigma_j,\\sigma_k]=2\\mathbf{i}\\varepsilon_{jkl}\\sigma_l~(j,k,l=1,2,3) \\] \\[ \\{\\sigma_i,\\sigma_j\\}=0~(i\\ne j; i,j=1,2,3) \\] \\[ \\sigma_i^2=\\sigma_0~(i=0,1,2,3) \\] \\[ \\sigma_j\\sigma_k=\\delta_{jk}\\sigma_0+\\mathbf{i}\\varepsilon_{jkl}\\sigma_l \\] Polar Decomposition: \\(A\\) is linear operator on \\(V\\). There exists unitary \\(U\\), positive \\(J\\) and \\(K\\) such \\(A=UJ=KU\\), where \\(J\\equiv\\sqrt{A^\\dagger A}\\), \\(K\\equiv\\sqrt{AA^\\dagger}\\). Moreover, if \\(A\\) is invertible, \\(U\\) is unique. Proof: Orthonormal decomposition \\(J=\\sqrt{A^\\dagger A}=\\sum_i\\lambda_i|i\\rangle\\langle i|\\). Define \\(|\\psi_i\\rangle=A|i\\rangle\\), then \\(\\langle\\psi_i|\\psi_j\\rangle=\\langle i|A^\\dagger A|j\\rangle=\\lambda^2_i\\delta_{ij}\\), then normalize \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) to \\(|e\\rangle\\) and randomly pick orthonormal substitutes for the non-normalizable part. Define \\(U|i\\rangle=|e_i\\rangle\\), \\(UJ=\\sum_i\\lambda_i|e_i\\rangle\\langle i|=A\\). Rest is trivial. Singular Value Decomposition: \\(A\\) is square matrix, there exists unitary \\(U,V\\), diagonal \\(D\\) with non-negative entries such \\(A=UDV\\). Diagonal elements of \\(D\\) are called singular values of \\(A\\). Proof: \\(A=SJ=STDT^\\dagger=UDV\\). The Postulates of Quantum Mechanics Postulate 1: Associated to any isolated physical system is a complex vector space with inner product (that is, a Hilbert space) known as the state space of the system. The system is completely described by its state vector, which is a unit vector in the system's state space. Postulate 2: The evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary transformation. That is, the state \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) of the system at time \\(t_1\\) is related to the state \\(|\\psi&#39;\\rangle\\) of the system at time \\(t_2\\) by a unitary operator \\(U\\) which depends only on the times \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\), \\[ |\\psi&#39;\\rangle=U|\\psi\\rangle \\] Postulate 2': The time evolution of the state of a closed quantume system is described by the Schr√∂dinger equation, \\[ \\mathbf{i}\\hbar\\frac{\\mbox{d}|\\psi\\rangle}{\\mbox{d}t}=H|\\psi\\rangle \\] In this equation, \\(\\hbar\\) is a physical constant known as Planck's constant whose value must be experimentally determined. The exact value is not important to us. In practice, it is common to absorb the factor \\(\\hbar\\) into \\(H\\), effectively setting \\(\\hbar=1\\). \\(H\\) is a fixed Hermitian operator known as the Hamiltonian of the closed system. Postulate 3: Quantum measurements are described by a collection \\(\\{M_m\\}\\) of measurement operators. These are operators acting on the state space of the system being measured. The index \\(m\\) refers to the measurement outcomes that may occur in the experiment. If the state of the quantum system is \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) immediately before the measurement then the probability that result \\(m\\) occurs is given by \\[ p(m)=\\langle\\psi|M_m^\\dagger M_m|\\psi\\rangle \\] and the state of the system after the measurement is \\[ \\frac{M_m|\\psi\\rangle}{\\sqrt{p(m)}} \\] The measurement operators satisfy the completeness equation, \\[ \\sum_mM_m^\\dagger M_m=I \\] The completeness equation expresses the fact that probabilites sum to one: \\[ 1=\\sum_mp(m) \\] As a special case of Postulate 3, Projective measurements(PVM): A projective measurement is described by an observable, \\(M\\), a Hermitian operator on the state space of the system being observed. The observable has a spectral decomposition, \\[ M=\\sum_mmP_m \\] where \\(P_m\\) is the projector onto the eigensubspace of \\(M\\) with eigenvalue \\(m\\). The possible outcomes of the measurement correspond to the eigenvalues, \\(m\\), of the observable. Upon measuring the state \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\), the probability of getting result \\(m\\) is given by \\[ p(m)=\\langle\\psi|P_m|\\psi\\rangle \\] Given that outcome \\(m\\) occurred, the state of the quantum system immediately after the measurement is \\[ \\frac{P_m|\\psi\\rangle}{\\sqrt{p(m)}} \\] More generally comes Positive Operator-Valued Measurement(POVM): A set \\(\\{E_m\\}\\) where \\(E_m\\equiv M_m^\\dagger M_m\\) and \\(\\sum_mE_m=1\\), \\(p(m)=\\langle\\psi|E_m|\\psi\\rangle\\). The set \\(\\{E_m\\}\\) is called a POVM of the system. A POVM can be any set such: (1) each \\(E_m\\) is positive (so as to define \\(M_m\\equiv\\sqrt{E_m}\\)); (2) completeness \\(\\sum_mE_m=I\\) is assured. Postulate 4: The state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product of the state spaces of the component physical systems. Moreover, if we have systems numbered \\(1\\) through \\(n\\), and system number \\(i\\) is prepared in the state \\(|\\psi_i\\rangle\\), then the joint state of the total system is \\(|\\psi_1\\rangle\\otimes|\\psi_2\\rangle\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes|\\psi_n\\rangle\\). The Density Operator Characterization of density operator: \\(\\rho\\) is density operator to \\(\\{p_i,|\\psi_i\\rangle\\}\\) iff (Trace condition) \\(\\mbox{tr}(\\rho)=1\\) (Positivity condition) \\(\\rho\\) is positive. Thus we can reformulate the postulates of quantum mechanics in the density operator picture. Postulate 1: Associated to any isolated physical system is a complex vector space with inner product (that is, Hilbert space) known as the state space of the system. The system is completely described by its density operator, which is a positive operator \\(\\rho\\) with trace one, acting on the state space of the system. If a quantum system is in the state \\(\\rho_i\\) with probability \\(p_i\\), then the density operator for the system is \\(\\sum_ip_i\\rho_i\\). Postulate 2: The evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary transformation. That is, the state \\(\\rho\\) of the system at time \\(t_1\\) is related to the state \\(\\rho&#39;\\) of the system ate time \\(t_2\\) by a unitary operator \\(U\\) which depends only on the times \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\), \\[ \\rho&#39;=U\\rho U^\\dagger \\] Postulate 3: Quantum measurements are described by a collection \\(\\{M_m\\}\\) of measurement operators. These are operators acting on the state space of the system being measured. The index \\(m\\) refers to the measurement outcomes that may occur in the experiment. If the state of the quantum system is \\(\\rho\\) immediately before the measurement then the probability that result \\(m\\) occurs is given by $$ \\[\\begin{align} p(m)&amp;= \\sum_ip(m|i)\\cdot p_i \\\\ &amp;=\\sum_i\\langle\\psi_i|M_m^\\dagger M_m|\\psi_i\\rangle\\cdot p_i \\\\ &amp;=\\mbox{tr}(M_m^\\dagger M_m\\rho) \\end{align}\\] \\[ and the state of the system after the measurement is \\] \\[ The measurement operators satisfy the *completeness equation*, \\] _mM_m^M_m=I $$ Postulate 4: The state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product of the state spaces of the component physical systems. Moreover, if we have systems numbered \\(1\\) through \\(n\\), and system number \\(i\\) is prepared in the state \\(\\rho_i\\), then the joint state of the total system is \\(\\rho_1\\otimes\\rho_2\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes\\rho_n\\). Unitary freedom in ensemble for density matrices: Denote \\(|\\tilde{\\psi_i}\\rangle\\equiv\\sqrt{p_i}|\\psi_i\\rangle\\), then a set \\(\\{|\\tilde{\\psi_i}\\rangle\\}\\) and \\(\\{|\\tilde{\\varphi_i}\\rangle\\}\\) generates the same density matrix iff \\(|\\tilde{\\psi_i}\\rangle=\\sum_ju_{ij}|\\tilde{\\varphi_j}\\rangle\\), where \\(u_{ij}\\) is unitary matrix. Proof: First justify the dimensionality. The two sets can always contain same number of vectors given 0 probability is allowed in the representation. If \\(|\\tilde{\\psi_i}\\rangle=\\sum_ju_{ij}|\\tilde{\\varphi_j}\\rangle\\), \\(\\rho_\\psi=\\sum_i|\\tilde{\\psi_i}\\rangle\\langle\\tilde{\\psi_i}|=\\sum_{ijk}u_{ij}u_{ik}^*|\\tilde{\\varphi_j}\\rangle\\langle\\tilde{\\varphi_k}|=\\rho_\\varphi\\). Conversely, if \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\varphi\\) represents the same state \\(\\rho=\\sum|\\tilde{\\psi_i}\\rangle\\langle\\tilde{\\psi_i}|=\\sum|\\tilde{\\varphi_j}\\rangle\\langle\\tilde{\\varphi_j}|\\), take orthornormal decomposition of the density matrix \\(\\rho=\\sum_k\\lambda_k|k\\rangle\\langle k|=\\sum_k|\\tilde k\\rangle\\langle\\tilde k|\\). If \\(|\\tilde k\\rangle\\) does not span the entire space, then for any \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) orthogonal to the space spanned by \\(|\\tilde k\\rangle\\), \\(0=\\langle\\psi|\\rho|\\psi\\rangle=\\sum_i\\langle\\psi|\\tilde{\\psi_i}\\rangle\\langle\\tilde{\\psi_i}|\\psi\\rangle\\), which leads to the result that \\(|\\tilde{\\psi_i}\\rangle\\) can be represented by the non-zero \\(|\\tilde k\\rangle\\)'s alone. Say \\(|\\tilde\\psi_i\\rangle=\\sum_kc_{ik}|\\tilde k\\rangle\\), then \\[ \\sum_k|\\tilde k\\rangle\\langle\\tilde k|=\\sum_{kl}(\\sum_ic_{ik}c_{il}^*)|\\tilde k\\rangle\\langle\\tilde l| \\] Then \\(c_{ik}\\) can be expanded to become a unitary matrix. Bloch sphere for mixed states \\(\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}(I+\\vec r\\cdot\\vec \\sigma)\\). A minimal ensemble for \\(\\rho\\) is an ensenmble \\(\\{p_i,|\\psi_i\\rangle\\}\\) containing a number of elements equal to the rank of \\(\\rho\\). \\(\\forall |\\psi\\rangle\\) in the support of \\(\\rho\\), there exists a minimal ensemble for \\(\\rho\\) that contains \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) as \\(|\\psi_i\\rangle\\) with probability \\(p_i=1/\\langle\\psi_i|\\rho^{-1}|\\psi_i\\rangle\\). This is done by explicitly \\(|\\tilde j\\rangle\\longrightarrow|\\tilde\\psi_j\\rangle\\) through unitary matrix. Reduced Density Operator \\(\\rho^A\\equiv\\mbox{tr}_B(\\rho^{AB})\\). Suppose \\(M\\) is any observable on system \\(A\\), let \\(\\tilde M\\) be the corresponding observable for the same measurement on composite system \\(AB\\). Then \\[ \\tilde M=M\\otimes I_B \\] as seen by special cases when \\(AB\\) is in the state \\(|m\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle\\). Moreover, \\[ \\tilde M=\\sum_mmP_m\\otimes I_B=M\\otimes I_B \\] Physical requirement that measurement averages should be \\[ \\mbox{tr}(M\\rho^A)=\\mbox{tr}((M\\otimes I_B)\\rho^{AB}) \\] which can be met choosing \\(\\rho^A\\equiv\\mbox{tr}_B(\\rho^{AB})\\), while for any \\(f(\\cdot)\\), if \\[ \\mbox{tr}(Mf(\\rho^{AB}))=\\mbox{tr}((M\\otimes I_B)\\rho^{AB}) \\] Pick orthonormal basis (under H-S inner product) for Hermitian operator \\(M_i\\), then \\[ f(\\rho^{AB})=\\sum_iM_i\\mbox{tr}(M_if(\\rho^{AB}))=\\sum_iM_i\\mbox{tr}((M_i\\otimes I_B)\\rho^{AB}) \\] which uniquely determines \\(f\\). Schmidt Decomposition: \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) is pure state of composite system \\(AB\\). There exists orthonormal basis \\(\\{|i_A\\rangle\\}\\), \\(\\{|i_B\\rangle\\}\\) such that \\[ |\\psi\\rangle=\\sum_i\\lambda_i|i_A\\rangle|i_B\\rangle \\] where \\(\\lambda_i\\) are non-negative real numbers called Schmidt coefficients with \\(\\sum_i\\lambda_i^2=1\\). (only for 2-partite systems) Proof: First the case where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have same dimensionality. Generally, \\(|\\psi\\rangle=\\sum_{jk}a_{jk}|j\\rangle|k\\rangle\\), where \\(|j\\rangle\\) and \\(|k\\rangle\\) are orthonormal basis of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) respectively. Using singular value decomposition \\(a=udv\\), we have \\[ \\begin{align} |\\psi\\rangle&amp;=\\sum_{ijk}u_{ji}d_{ii}v_{ik}|j\\rangle|k\\rangle\\\\ &amp;=\\sum_id_{ii}(\\sum_ju_{ji}|j\\rangle)(\\sum_kv_{ki}|k\\rangle)\\\\ &amp;=\\sum_id_{ii}|i_A\\rangle|i_B\\rangle \\end{align} \\] For the case where \\(n=\\dim A\\ge\\dim B=m\\), treat \\(a_{jk}\\) as an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix with the rightest \\((n-m)\\) columns empty. Then the singular value decomposition gives \\(a=udv\\) with its block-diagonal form obvious enough to render the above thesis valid. (using \\(\\sqrt{A^\\dagger A}\\)) As a consequence, \\(\\rho^A=\\sum_i\\lambda_i^2|i_A\\rangle\\langle i_A|\\), and likewise for \\(\\rho^B=\\sum_i\\lambda_i^2|i_B\\rangle\\langle i_B|\\). \\(|i_A\\rangle\\) and \\(|i_B\\rangle\\) are called Schmidt bases. Schmidt number is defined by the number of non-zero \\(\\lambda_i\\)'s in a Schmidt decomposition for \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\), it quantifies the amount of entanglement. Given a pure state, its Schmidt number can be immediately determined by taking \\(\\mbox{rank}(\\rho^A)\\). Schmidt number is preserved under unitary transformation on system \\(A\\) or system \\(B\\) alone, since under respective evolution entanglement is maintained. Only when there is interaction may the entanglement between the two subsystems be varied. Pure state of composite system \\(AB\\) is a product state iff it has Schmidt # 1, iff \\(\\rho^A\\) and \\(\\rho^B\\) are pure. To elaborate the latter, if \\(\\rho^A\\) pure, Schmidt # = 1. QUESTION: For \\(\\rho^{AB}\\), if \\(\\rho^A\\) pure, is \\(\\rho^{AB}\\) pure? Even if \\(\\rho^{AB}\\) is not pure, we purify it to yield a pure system \\(ABC\\), in which \\(\\mbox{tr}_{BC}(|ABC\\rangle\\langle ABC|)=\\rho^A\\) is pure. Then \\(\\rho^{BC}\\) is pure as well. Thus \\(ABC\\) is product state of \\(A,\\{BC\\}\\), namely \\(|a\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle_{BC}\\). The overall effect is that we introduced an ancilla system to purify \\(B\\), and \\(AB\\) as well. If we have furthermore that \\(\\rho^B\\) is pure, we can then conclude that \\(\\rho^C\\) is pure and then \\(\\rho^{AB}\\) is pure. Purification: Given \\(\\rho^A\\), there exists \\(R\\) (reference system) such that \\(|AR\\rangle\\) is pure, with natural reduction \\(\\rho^A=\\mbox{tr}_R(|AR\\rangle\\langle AR|)\\). This can be done by finding orthonormal decomposition of \\(\\rho^A=\\sum p_i|i^A\\rangle\\langle i^A|\\) and picking \\(|AR\\rangle=\\sum_i\\sqrt{p_i}|i^A\\rangle|i^R\\rangle\\). \\(|\\psi\\rangle=(U\\otimes V)|\\varphi\\rangle\\) transform pure state to another pure state. Freedom in purifications If \\(|AR_1\\rangle\\) and \\(|AR_2\\rangle\\) are two purifications of a state \\(\\rho^A\\) to a composite system \\(AR\\). There exists \\(|AR_1\\rangle=(I_A\\otimes U_R)|AR_2\\rangle\\). If we introduce ancilla system \\(R\\) of same dimensionality as \\(A\\), and set any orthonormal basis \\(|i_A\\rangle\\), \\(|i_R\\rangle\\). Denote maximum entangled state \\(|m\\rangle\\equiv\\sum_i|i_R\\rangle|i_A\\rangle\\). Then any purification of the system \\(\\rho^A\\) can be written \\[ |AR\\rangle=(U_R\\otimes\\sqrt{\\rho^A}U_A)|m\\rangle \\] Properties of Schmidt number Suppose \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) is pure state of \\(\\{A,B\\}\\). \\(\\mbox{Sch}(|\\psi\\rangle)=\\mbox{rank}(\\rho^A)\\) Proof: Schmidt decomposition \\(|\\psi\\rangle=\\sum_i\\lambda_i|i_A\\rangle|i_B\\rangle\\). \\(\\rho^A=\\sum_i\\lambda_i^2|i_A\\rangle\\langle i_A|\\). Suppose \\(|\\psi\\rangle=\\sum_j|\\alpha_j\\rangle|\\beta_j\\rangle\\) is a representation. The # of terms in such a decomposition \\(\\ge\\mbox{Sch}(|\\psi\\rangle)\\). Proof: Schmidt decomposition \\(|\\psi\\rangle=\\sum_i\\lambda_i|i_A\\rangle|i_B\\rangle=\\sum_j\\mu_j|\\tilde\\alpha_j\\rangle|\\tilde\\beta_j\\rangle\\), where tilde gives normalized vectors. From this \\(\\rho^A=\\sum_i\\lambda_i^2|i_A\\rangle\\langle i_A|=\\sum_j\\mu_j^2|\\tilde\\alpha_j\\rangle\\langle\\tilde\\alpha_j|\\), we can actually link \\[ \\lambda_i|i_A\\rangle=\\sum_ju_{ij}\\mu_j|\\tilde\\alpha_j\\rangle \\] If # of terms for \\(|\\alpha_i\\rangle\\) is smaller than \\(\\mbox{Sch}(|\\psi\\rangle)\\), it would not be possible for such linear representation to hold. Suppose \\(|\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|\\varphi\\rangle+\\beta|\\gamma\\rangle\\), then \\(\\mbox{Sch}(\\psi)\\ge|\\mbox{Sch}(\\varphi)-\\mbox{Sch}(\\gamma)|\\). Proof: Since \\(|\\psi\\rangle-\\alpha|\\varphi\\rangle=\\beta|\\gamma\\rangle\\). LHS is a representation, having \\(\\mbox{Sch}(\\psi)+\\mbox{Sch}(\\varphi)\\) terms. Thus from (b) we have \\(\\mbox{Sch}(\\psi)+\\mbox{Sch}(\\varphi)\\ge\\mbox{Sch}(\\gamma)\\). And the other way around. ###EPR&amp; Bell Inequality Measurement via apparatus analysis System \\(Q\\) and ancilla system \\(M\\) interacts to give the outcome of a full measurement. Consider \\(Q\\) in the state \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) and \\(M\\) in the state \\(|0\\rangle\\) initially. \\(M\\) has a set of orthonormal states as basis \\(|m\\rangle\\). Thus the evolution of the composite system is written \\[ U|\\psi\\rangle|0\\rangle=\\sum_m (M_m\\otimes I)|\\psi\\rangle|m\\rangle \\] The unitary property is reserved iff \\[ \\begin{align} (U|\\varphi\\rangle|0\\rangle,U|\\psi\\rangle|0\\rangle)&amp;=\\sum_m\\langle\\varphi|M_m^\\dagger M_m|\\psi\\rangle\\\\ &amp;=\\langle\\varphi|\\psi\\rangle \\end{align} \\] which requires that \\(\\sum_m M_m^\\dagger M_m=I\\). Exploiting the semi-classical nature of the apparatus, as an outcome of the measurement action, do projection \\(P_m=I\\otimes|m\\rangle\\langle m|\\), yielding the outcome composite state \\[ \\frac{M_m|\\psi\\rangle} {\\sqrt{\\langle\\psi|M_m^\\dagger M_m|\\psi\\rangle}}\\otimes|m\\rangle \\] And the corresponding probablity is given by \\[ p(m)=\\frac{\\langle\\psi|M_m^\\dagger M_m|\\psi\\rangle}{\\sum_m\\langle\\psi|M_m^\\dagger M_m|\\psi\\rangle}=\\langle\\psi|M_m^\\dagger M_m|\\psi\\rangle \\]","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Quantum Information","slug":"Quantum-Information","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Quantum-Information/"}]}],"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Quantum Information","slug":"Quantum-Information","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Quantum-Information/"}]}
